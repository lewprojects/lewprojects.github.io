            <p>My Data Odyssey: From Teaching to Tech</p>
          </header>
          <p>
            In 2006, I got a degree that meant a lot to me but wasn't too
            marketable: Music Composition. Saddled with a large amount of
            student loan debt and eager to get out of my parents basement, I
            traveled to South Korea to teach ESL and pay down my loans.
          </p>

          <p>
            During my time there, I found it was difficult to motivate the
            students, so I started to incorporate A/V materials into my lessons.
            Unbeknownst to me, this was the start of my data journey. I began
            extracting, cleaning, analyzing and visualizing data in order to
            improve my classes. Of course, I didn't know that at the time; I was
            just doing what I could to help my students.
          </p>
          <div class="image main"><img src="images/SE.png" alt="" /></div>
          <p>
            I returned to the US in 2018 and was hired to build a band program
            at a local charter school. During COVID, I was tasked with putting
            on a marching show, with 20 students, no instruments or uniforms and a
            tiny budget of 10,000 dollars. Since there were so many things to
            organize, I took some project management courses on LinkedIn
            Learning. Armed with a Gantt chart I made in Microsoft Project laying out my tasks, milestones
            and project timeline, I set to work doing everything I could to put
            on a show. I succeeded.
          </p>
          <div class="image main"><img src="images/band.png" alt="" /> <center><i>One parent labled us "The cutest marching band in Texas."</i></center></div>
          <p>
            After seeing my work organizing the band program, the admin at the
            school asked me to organize a computer science program. I was
            extremely hesitant because I had no interest in coding whatsoever.
            Isn't that just a bunch of math, ones and zeroes and hexidecimals? I
            was <i>extremely</i> apprehensive about. My admin recommended using a free program
            code.org that had a pre-made easy-to-follow curriculum. Now I was just apprehensive.
          </p>

          <p>
            But as it turned out, I really enjoyed learning to code and learning
            about the software development process with the students. Coding was
            much more about problem solving than math. And code.org's curriculum
            was less focused on teaching facts and more focused on developing and
            implementing a team based, project centered computer science
            curriculum. Students learned about internet safety, the software
            development process, AI, and machine learning. Students completed
            individual and group projects building websites, games and app
            prototypes using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <div class="image main"><img src="images/platform.png" alt="" /><center><i>JavaScript game made by one of my students.</i></center></div>
          <p>
            Because I enjoyed the the project management aspect of my job much
            more than the teaching aspect (and since teaching wasn't paying the
            bills), I decided I would try to see if I could get hired as a
            project manager. I got certified as a Scrum Master in 2022 as well
            as a PMP certification. Unfortunately, the job market in 2023 was
            rough. While job searching it became obvious that I needed some kind
            of specialization to break into project management. I decided to try
            and specialize in data analysis.
          </p>
          <div class="image main"><img src="images/dev.png" alt="" /></div>
          <p>
            In 2023, I started the Google Data Analytics certification and was
            shocked to find that everything I had been doing in Korea to create
            AV curriculum was the <i>exact</i> process data analysts also used.
            Additionally, I found that the coding instruction I had done more
            than prepared me to work with SQL and Python. I completed my
            certificate in early 2024 and have been working with data ever since.
